## JSON

A small C++20 library that can parse and serialize JSON.

### Building

You must have `premake5` and a supported building system.

Builds can be found inside the `build` folder, and include files inside the `include` directory.

### Running Tests

Build the `json-dev` project and run its executable. The executable's working directory **MUST** be the root of this repo.
